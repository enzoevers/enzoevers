- 👋 Hi, I’m @enzoevers
- 👀 I’m interested in building and learning about all things (embedded) engineering related. In my free time I like to either work on personal projects or build and fly (FPV) drones and planes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning smart contract development, embedded architectures and compiler design.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enzo-evers-766331119/). Sometimes I put something project or hobby related on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwGMtaOywHGnWdXyHskHbWw).
